### PURPOSE, USERS, SCOPE

##### What problem(s) does your app solve?

It can be difficult for hobbyist musicians to find other musicians in their area to collaborate with.  Beyond merely finding collaborators, songwriter’s block is a reality.  Sometimes, bouncing an idea off another musician for feedback is instrumental in helping develop and progress that idea into a completion.  

##### How does it solve those problems?

RIFFR provides a venue for users to post a guitar riff, a drum beat, a synthesizer lead, or other audio snippet for collaboration and feedback. The user registers and creates a profile where they will list things like their general location (ie, Greater Salt Lake City area), the instruments they play and their recording experience , the genres they listen to, their favorite bands, favorite gear, gear rig, etc.


##### Who is your target user?

Musicians looking for inspiration, collaboration, and a sense of community.


##### How much experience do they have with technology?

With the proliferation of digital audio workstations, digital sampling, and more, modern musicians tend to be very technologically inclined.  Complex DAWs like Pro Tools, Logic, and Ableton Live require a strong understanding of software and hardware. 


##### Use case examples:

“I am new to this town and I don’t have anyone to play music with. If there were an app for helping me connect with local musicians, it’d be a great way to meet new people.”

“I’ve been toying with this idea, but I’m struggling to hash it out into a full-fledged song.  It’d be great to bounce this idea off of some other songwriters.”

“I love collaborating with other artists and hearing a project evolve.”

“I’m always looking for audio samples, browsing sites like LANDR to find new sounds.  It would be great to find more diverse sounds.”
